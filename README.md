## üíº Entity Relationship diagram

I really like planning before taking the first step. So, after finalizing the features to include in **SigmaFit MVP**, I started working on the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Here is the ERD built using [draw.io](https://draw.io):

## ‚è≠ What's Next
1. In the next version, we shall allow people to join friend circles to track each other's progress. It will keep everyone motivated to do physical activity and stay healthy.
2. In future, we shall also add offline support. (Currently, some functionalities can work offline ü§´, but there is no logic to fix the synchronization conflicts üò¢).
